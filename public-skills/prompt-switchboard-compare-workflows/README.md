# Prompt Switchboard Compare Workflows Public Skill

This folder is the public, self-contained skill packet for Prompt Switchboard.
It is meant to travel into host skill registries without forcing the reviewer to
read the whole source repository first.

## Purpose

Use it when you want one portable skill folder that teaches four things inside
the skill package itself:

- how to install the local MCP sidecar
- how to wire that MCP server into OpenHands or OpenClaw
- what MCP tools Prompt Switchboard exposes
- what a good first compare workflow looks like in practice

## What this packet includes

- `SKILL.md`
  - the agent-facing workflow prompt
- `manifest.yaml`
  - listing metadata for registry-style distribution
- `references/INSTALL.md`
  - install and host wiring guide
- `references/CAPABILITIES.md`
  - exposed MCP tools and recommended first-use path
- `references/DEMO.md`
  - exact demo prompts and success criteria
- `references/OPENHANDS_MCP_CONFIG.json`
  - host config snippet for `mcpServers`
- `references/OPENCLAW_MCP_CONFIG.json`
  - host config snippet for `mcp.servers`

## Best-fit hosts

- OpenHands/extensions contribution flow
- ClawHub-style skill publication
- repo-local skill import flows that expect a standalone folder with its own
  install and demo references

## What this packet must not claim

- no live OpenHands/extensions listing without fresh PR/read-back
- no live ClawHub listing without fresh host-side read-back
- no hosted Glama deployment, Docker catalog listing, or public relay claim
- no official MCP Registry listing by itself

## Source of truth

This folder is a public-facing derived packet. Keep it aligned with the source
repo, but do not make reviewers rely on repo-root docs to understand the skill:

- `README.md`
- `docs/mcp-coding-agents.html`
- `server.json`

If the product boundary or MCP workflow changes, update this packet before
submitting it again.
